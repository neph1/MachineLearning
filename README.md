Summary of my machine learning experiments

This is a summary of various experiments I've performed over the years, mostly if not only, for fun:

NeuroKotlin: https://github.com/neph1/NeuroKotlin
Adaptation of a backprop framework I made first to verify assignments during courses, then to make a bot for Codingame's "Mad Pod Racing" (formerly known as "Coders Strike Back"): https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back

Kaggle's titanic challenge: https://github.com/neph1/dl4j-kaggle-titanic
Trying out dl4j with Kaggle.

OpenAI's cartpole environments (sadly no longer available):
CartPole-v1: https://gist.github.com/neph1/9202f89acb6762922c356e49f8f60e98
CartPole-v0: https://gist.github.com/neph1/4a52977c5901cb3e7b736a78173ed5f7
This is how I found dl4j and included some bug fixes to their gym-java-client: https://github.com/neph1/gym-java-client

RL Quad Rocket:
Inspired by the Lander environments on OpenAI I tried to create my own variant of a self balancing rocket. Only videos available:
